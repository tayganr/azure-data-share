# azure-data-share
Azure Data Share is a fully managed service that enables organisations to share data across tenants (B2B), simply and securely. Data can be consumed as needed by triggering a full copy or incremental update. Alternatively, data can be received automatically at a regular interval, as defined by the data provider.
